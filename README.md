## Usage Scenarios
### Education
Ant Media can provide virtual classrooms with teachers as many as it is required and it might be presented and viewed separately with ultra-low latency.
### IP camera streaming
Watch and Monitor IP Cameras with Ultra Low Latency on Web Browser with Ant Media Server. You can embed ONVIF IP camera streams into your websites and mobile applications.
### Webinar
Ant Media Server supports N-N live video/audio conferencing by using WebRTC protocol that allows you to achieve ultra-low latency which is around 0.5 sec. Ant Media Server also provides scalability that can help you to scale up your solution dynamically.
### Mobile Streaming Application
Easy to Integrate and Scalable Streaming Infrastructure Solutions for your Mobile Application Projects. You can build fast ve stable streaming applications with Ant Media API’s and SDK’s.
### Live Game Show
Scale Number of Viewers As Much As You Need. Live Video Experience has the significant role in Live Game Shows’ success. It must be scalable, low latency and adaptive.  Ant Media Server provides scalable, ultra-low latency and adaptive streaming.
### E-sports Betting
Due to the biggest grow at esports, there is a tremendous demand for betting more   than normal sports and video streaming with ultra-low latency is a game changer for  that industry.
### Auction and Bidding Streaming
Live Auction should be streamed with ultra sub second latency in order to get bids on
time. Otherwise, your items get sold for a lower price. Ant Media Server provides sub-second  latency streaming.
### Video Game Streaming
Gamers are generally complaining about interaction problems. Ant Media Server resolves this problem by ultra low latency streaming(0.5 second) via WebRTC.
